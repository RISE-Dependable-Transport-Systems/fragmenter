The project also seeks to enhance ICT and data man-\nagement systems to support extensive field demonstrations that address\ngenuine industrial demands. WayWise is being used to prototype func-\ntions that enhance safety-critical situational awareness of autonomous\nmobile machines in forest environments, both in model and real scale.\nResearch questions include safety and cybersecurity aspects as well as\nusing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles 3 to extend the machinery’s point of\nview for protecting humans. More details on the use case and challenges\ncan be found in [11].\nIn the SUNRISE EU project [12], which focuses on the safety\nassurance of Cooperative, Connected, and Automated Mobility (CCAM)\nsystems, WayWise plays a vital role in prototyping and demonstrations.\nThe project aims to develop a standardized safety assurance framework\nthat will undergo rigorous testing through various realistic scenarios.\nThese scenarios cover a diverse array of CCAM systems and appli-\ncations, from urban and highway navigation of personal vehicles to\nautomated parking of commercial freight trucks. Currently, WayWise\nis being utilized to develop a model-scale prototype of a truck with\na trailer for showcasing automated parking in a logistics hub as an\nintermediate step toward real-scale testing.\nAnother significant application of WayWise is in the LASH FIRE\nEU project [13], which is an international research initiative aimed at\nminimizing fire risks aboard roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) ships. The project\nexplored the feasibility of integrating Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)\ninto fire and rescue operations. The objective was to prototype and\nassess feasibility and usefulness of a UAS designed for the maritime\nenvironment that could conduct automated fire patrols, assist in fire\nresource management, and perform search and rescue missions. Way-\nWise facilitated rapid prototyping of the system, providing valuable\ninsights and feedback when creating a survey targeted at professionals\nin maritime operations and UAS technology that resulted in a SWOT\n(Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis. The findings\nwill be presented in [14], a project report with technical details is\navailable [15].\nThe agrifoodTEF EU project [16], spanning across Europe, fo-\ncuses on assessing and validating third-party AI and Robotics solutions\nin real-world agricultural conditions. The Swedish ‘‘satellite’’ of agri-\nfoodTEF, centered around the RISE Testbed Digitalized Agriculture,\nserves as a hub for developing, testing, and demonstrating products and\nservices related to agriculture and food production. Key features of this\ntestbed include a full-scale tractor prototype called Drever 120 with an\nelectric driveline featuring four motors with 30 kW power each. Drever\n120 was automated using WayWise and demonstrated together with a\nprototype automated battery swap system in front of all EU agriculture\nministers [17].\nThrough these diverse projects, WayWise has demonstrated its util-\nity and adaptability in various applications, reinforcing its role as an\neffective tool in the development and testing of autonomous systems\nacross different sectors.\n3. Future directions and conclusion\nWayWise has proven to be an effective tool in autonomous vehicle\nresearch, providing a modular, flexible, and robust platform for rapid\nprototyping, testing, and validation of connected autonomous vehicles\nand UASs. Built with C++ and Qt, WayWise integrates vehicle dy-\nnamics, control systems, communication protocols, and user interface\ncomponents, supporting diverse research and development needs with\nCOTS hardware compatibility and advanced sensor integration. Its\neffectiveness is showcased in projects like AGRARSENSE, SUNRISE,\nLASH FIRE, and agrifoodTEF, enhancing situational awareness, safety,\nand operational efficiency.\n3 Implemented using PX4 [10] and communicating to WayWise via\nMAVLINK.\nLooking ahead, the main developments on control station and ve-\nhicles side are multi vehicle support and ROS2 [18] integration, re-\nspectively. ControlTower recently received support to manage multiple\nvehicles including autopilot control and monitoring. This enables inves-\ntigating research questions where vehicles interact more tightly, e.g., to\nincrease worksite safety as in the AGRARSENSE project.\nOn the vehicle side, our recently established WayWiseR 4 project\nintegrates the rapid prototyping capability of WayWise with ROS2.', 'M. Damschen, R. Häll and A. Mirzai Software Impacts 21 (2024) 100682\nFig. 1. Summary of WayWise’s capabilities including control station and various types of vehicles.\nRCCar1 and ControlTower2 are our flagship projects for WayWise,\nwhere RCCar represents the vehicle side and ControlTower the control\nsystem desktop application.\n1.1. Key features\nWayWise is organized into several components (highlighted in bold\nin the following) to address different aspects of autonomous vehicle\ndevelopment. At its foundation, the core component includes funda-\nmental classes and headers for tasks such as storing positions and\ntransforming coordinates, with support for both relative coordinates in\nEast-North-Up (ENU) and global coordinates in longitude and latitude,\nensuring precise geospatial handling. Communication is a crucial\naspect, where WayWise handles both external and internal commu-\nnication needs. Externally, it mainly uses the MAVLINK protocol im-\nplemented via MAVSDK [1], enabling robust and flexible interactions\nbetween vehicles and control stations. WayWise is generally proto-\ncol agnostic, though. For example, it additionally supports ISO/TS\n22133 [2], a protocol for active safety and automated vehicle testing.\nThe support was contributed by AstaZero, a full-scale test environ-\nment for autonomous transport systems in Sweden [3]. For internal\ncommunication in more complex vehicles, WayWise supports vehicle\ncommunication to lower-level controls using the CANopen protocol\nthrough the Lely CANopen library [4].\nThe vehicles component comprises classes that store the state of\ndifferent vehicle types, facilitating straight forward kinematic simu-\nlations within a desktop application or on the vehicles themselves.\nVarious vehicle types, including rc cars, drones, and full-sized machin-\nery are supported. Sensor integration is another vital component, and\nWayWise includes broad support for sensors such as positioning using\nGNSS (including Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) with a focus on u-blox\nreceivers [5]), IMUs, Ultra Wide Band (UWB, using Pozyx [6]). Further,\nDepthAI [7] has been integrated to prototype AI-enabled functionality\nlike keeping a safe distance from or following persons.\nAutopilot defines a generic interface, ‘‘WaypointFollower’’, for im-\nplementing autopilot functionalities. Notable implementations include\na pure pursuit-based autopilot [8] and the ‘‘MultiWaypointFollower’’,\n1 https://github.com/RISE-Dependable-Transport-Systems/RCCar\n2 https://github.com/RISE-Dependable-Transport-Systems/ControlTower\nwhich allows for switching between multiple WaypointFollowers. This\nflexibility supports complex use cases such as following a route, pausing\nfor charging, and resuming the route. Also following moving points\n(like detected persons) is implemented here. WayWise further provides\nan easy-to-integrate logger, allowing data from vehicles to be effi-\nciently logged and transmitted to the control station for analysis and\ndebugging.\nAdditionally, the library includes user interface building blocks\nfor creating desktop applications, most notably a map module for dis-\nplaying vehicle positions on OpenStreetMap with modular extensions\nfor creating routes and tracing movements. It further features route\nplanning using a configurable route generator currently focusing on\nagricultural applications.\n1.2. Technological advancements\nWayWise demonstrates technological advancements in autonomous\nvehicle research through its modular and flexible architecture. Built\non C++ and Qt, it allows seamless integration of vehicle dynamics,\ncontrol systems, and communication protocols. It supports a wide range\nof vehicles, from model-sized cars to full-sized machinery, and provides\neffective means for both external (MAVLINK, ISO/TS 22133) and inter-\nnal (CANopen) communications. Advanced sensor integration (GNSS,\nIMUs, UWB, DepthAI) enhances environmental perception and navi-\ngation, while its ‘‘WaypointFollower’’ autopilot functionalities support\ncomplex use cases effectively. Compatible with COTS hardware and of-\nfering cross-platform capabilities, WayWise provides a comprehensive\ntoolset for rapid prototyping, making it a vital resource for developing\nand testing autonomous systems across various applications. Its design\nensures that it can meet diverse research and development needs,\nsupporting the exploration and validation of new technologies and\nmethodologies in the autonomous systems domain.\n2. Case studies and impact\nWayWise has been integral to various research projects, showcasing\nits versatility and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.']"
